### 👋 Hey, I’m Amir

🔨 I love **building things** and **automating everything**, especially at scale.

💾 I’ve been coding since I was 14, and these days I work as an **independent software engineer and consultant**, helping startups and teams build and scale their infrastructure. Most of my recent work has been around **software architecture and system design**, but I’ve never stopped coding.

💻 I’m mainly a **backend developer**, though I’ve also built plenty of **frontend apps**, **Linux system tools**, and even a few **Android** and **Windows** desktop applications.

🧰 Over the years, I’ve shipped production code in **Python**, **Go**, **Scala**, **Java**, **TypeScript/JavaScript**, **C#**, **C/C++**, **HTML/CSS**, and more. I don’t believe good engineers should be tied to one language, but if I had to pick favorites, these days it’s **Python** and **Rust**.

🐧 I’m passionate about **Linux** and the **open-source world**.
