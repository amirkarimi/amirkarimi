Hi :wave: My name is Amir.

ðŸ”¨ I love building stuff and automating things at scale.

:floppy_disk: I've been coding since age 14. Currently, I'm an independent software engineer working as a consultant focusing on infrastructure. In recent years I've mostly been designing and architecting software applications. But have never been away from coding. Though I've usually been a backend developer, I also have developed a lot of frontend web apps as well as a few Linux system software, Android and Windows desktop apps, etc.

ðŸ§° I have built different applications in `Python`, `Go`, `Scala`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `C#`, `C/C++`, `HTML/CSS` (and more) that are running in production. I don't think a good software engineer should be limited to a specific language but if I get to choose, these days, I'm most interested in working with `Python` and `Go`.

:penguin: Linux and everything open source is my passion.
