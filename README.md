Hi :wave:

:hammer: I love building stuff and automating things at scale.

:floppy_disk: I've been coding since the age of 14. In recent years I've mostly been designing and architecting software applications. But have never been away from coding. I've usually been a backend developer but also have developed a lot of web frontend as well as some Linux system software, Android and Windows desktop apps, etc.

:penguin: Linux and everything open source is my passion. I have written software apps in `Python`, `Go`, `Scala`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `C#`, `C/C++` (probably others) that are running in production. I don't think a good software engineer should be limited to a specific language but if I get to choose, these days, I'm most interested in working with `Python`, `Go` and `Rust`.
