Hi :wave:

I love building stuff and automating things at scale :scroll:

I've been coding since the age of 14. In recent years I've mostly been designing and architecting software applications. But have never been far away from coding. I've usually been a backend developer but also have developed a lot of web frontend as well as some Linux system software, Android and Windows desktop apps, etc.

Linux and everything open source is my passion. I have written software apps in `Python`, `Go`, `Scala`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `C#`, `C/C++` (probably others). At the moment I'm most interested in coding with `Python`, `Go` and `Rust` but I don't think a good software engineer should be limited to a specific language.
